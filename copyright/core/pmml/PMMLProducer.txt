Hi David,

 

Yes, that did the trick. I've just done a couple of tests and things are
looking good! There were just a couple of modifications required:

 

1. The functionName was set to "regression" in the generated PMML - this
should be "classification" for logistic regression

2. The normalizationMethod needed to be set to "softmax" rather than "logit"
for multinomial logistic regression.

 

Once I made these changes, I tested on the iris and vote UCI data sets. For
vote I used a version with missing values already replaced in the data (I'll
test the PMML missing value replacement tomorrow). I used the "re-evaluate
model on current test set" contextual menu option in the Explorer and
compared the PMML model results to those from Logistic. Results were
identical (to the 4 decimal places printed by the Explorer). This includes
RMSE and MAE, which measure the accuracy of the probability estimates. So
the probabilities produced by the PMML model appear to be correct. Some more
datasets need to be tried of course, but it is looking pretty good!

 

I'll take a look at altering Logistic to just store means/modes in an array
over the weekend (or next week sometime) and then look to get your changes
checked in to the trunk.

 

I can't remember if I've asked you this already - are you willing to give
copyright for these contributions to the University of Waikato? Occasionally
the university manages to sell a commercial license for Weka, and some of
the proceeds come back to the ML group for supporting research students,
conference trips etc. If you say yes it will make my job easier as I have to
maintain a separate code line for Weka that is in sync with trunk but sans
non-waikato copyright and patented code :-)

 

Cheers,

Mark.

I see. You can just rename DELIMITER.java to DELIMITER2.java (and also
update its references in Delimiter.java). And do the same for TIMEANCHOR. I

for all possible pmml objects, most of the generated classes will not be

Hi David,

 

I've just started to take a look at your latest stuff. It's looking pretty
cool, but I haven't been able to compile it. There is a major problem with
these automatically generated JAXB bindings for us Mac users - Macs have a
case-insensitive file system by default. DELIMITER.java overwrites
Delimiter.java when I unpack your zip. The same problem occurs with
Timeanchor/TIMEANCHOR. I guess I could (under Linux) rename these classes
manually (and grep for all references to them) to eliminate the collisions.
I've never used JAXB before - do you know of any elegant solution to this?

 

I was going to modify Logistic.buildClassifier() to just create an array
member variable to hold all the means/modes rather than keep a copy of the
unfiltered training data hanging around. But I need to be able to compile it
all first :-)

 

Cheers,

Mark.

Hi Mark,

 

Thanks, now it works.

 

Attached is a zip file containing the current additions for the Logistic
model. The DataDictionary, TransformationDictionary, MiningSchema and
marshaling of the created object can be used in other models as well, so
these implementations should be moved to some general location. It would be
handy if it's integrated in the WEKA source before starting with the Neural
Network implementation. The most important question remaining is the
following:

 

-          To make the toPMML function more easy to implement and for
getting the meanOrMode I have introduced a new class variable Instances
m_structue_before which is initialized in the beginning of the
buildClassifier method (line 647) and stores the original format of the
train set including all of its instances. Of course this reference has to be
set to NULL before serialization and so on. You know better how to handle
this then me, or maybe there is a better way, can you take a look at it?

 

The other additions in the zip file are:

-          Function toPMML in weka.classifiers.functions.Logistic

-          The PMMLProducer interface which Logistic implements is placed in
package weka.core.pmml

-          The generated JAXB objects are located in
weka.core.pmml.jaxbbindings

 

 

I was surprised R only exports PMML and has no way of importing it and using
it afterwards. It can be read as an XMLNode, but not used to make
predictions afterwards. Do you know if there exists a website where the PMML
file can be checked? It would be nice to actually be able to test the PMML
file by making predictions in another package, maybe it is possible with
KNIME?

Hi David,

 

The problem is that you have "missingValueTreatment" declared in the pmml
file but not "missingValueReplacement". The former is just for informational
uses ("asMean" is useless by itself if we don't have access to tha training
data from which to compute the mean) and the later is what we really need. I
modified the logit.pmml file and added missingValueReplacement="3.1415" for
the "ps" field - see the attached screenshot of the model loaded into the
Explorer.

That's what I thought, see the following file (everything is still on the

an error:

'[Regression] WARNING: Instance to predict has missing value(s) but there is
no missing value handling meta data and no prior probabilities/default value
to fall back on. No prediction will be made (zero probabilities output).'

on line 725 in Regression, because miningSchema.hasTargetMetaData fails, so
that's where the confusion started. Maybe something has to change in
importing of the PMML file into WEKA?

Hi David,

 

No, you won't have to muck around with Target. From memory, that is for
making a default prediction in the case that there are missing values
present in a test instance and no missing values treatment has been
specified in the mining schema.

 

If you take a look at line 698 in Regression, you'll see that it makes a
call to MappingInfo.instanceToSchema(). This maps the incoming instance
values to the format specified by the mining schema and also applies missing
value and outlier treatments. Line 291 in MappingInfo calls
miningSchema.applyMissingAndOutlierTreatments(), which in turn calls
MiningFieldMetaInfo.applyMissingValueTreatment() for each attribute.

 

So your MiningFields need to look something like:

 

 
 
 
<MiningField name="foo" missingValueReplacement="3.14"
missingValueTreatment="asMean" />
 
 
The missingValueReplacement would be a string a for nominal attribute. The
missingValueTreatment field is for information only I believe.
 
 
Cheers,
 
 
Mark.

Do you have an example of how it is supposed to work using MiningSchema

is going to check hasTargetMetaData on mining schema, so I probably have to
create a Target inside a Targets class somehow and add it to the
MiningSchema? But I do not see that in the definition in

Hi David,

 

I've just started to take a look at this. Aside from issue with slightly
different probability estimates (and this might just be due to small
numerical differences from rounding), the main problem I can see is with
missing values handling. ps is 78% missing and size is 94% missing in the
data. This is not a transformation dictionary thing, but instead can be
specified in the mining schema:

 

http://www.dmg.org/v3-2/MiningSchema.html

 

The ReplaceMissingValues filter uses the mean for numeric variables and the
mode for nominal ones. For Logistic, 100% missing attributes is not an issue
because they get removed by the RemoveUseless filter.

 

Otherwise it is looking pretty cool!

 

Cheers,
Mark.

 

P.S. the xml is kind of hard to read - on my Mac it appears all on one line
in Emacs :-)

Hi Mark,

I finally had some days to work on the PMML export. I got some thoughts /
questions I like to share with you.

I started with the Logistic classifier, the result is the logit.pmml file
that is attached. I also attach the dataset on which the Logistic classifier
is trained. Can you take a look at the resulting pmml file? I used the PMML
Regression model instead of the PMML GeneralRegression model. Not because of
a particular reason, but because the first example I stumbled upon did it
that way. Do we need to be able to export the GeneralRegression model? Is
the GeneralRegression preferred above the Regression model somehow since
PMML 4.1?

I tested the exported model by importing it in WEKA and calling the
distributionForInstance function on the resulting
weka.classifiers.pmml.consumer.Regression class for the first instance in
the training set. The outcome differs from the original Logistic model;
0.002058/0.997941 versus 0.004099/0.995900. Not a big difference but a
difference anyway. I did not find an explanation for the different outcome
yet, do you have an idea? Maybe the paystaxes should be added to the
TransformationDictionary because it is also changed by the
ReplaceMissingValues filter? Not sure yet about how the DerivedField should
look like though.

The LinearRegression / SimpleLogistic classifiers should be quite easy to
export to PMML right now. I hope to do that soon and will try and export the
MultilayerPerceptron after that. What is the most handy way to share my code
with you so it can be added to the WEKA source tree later on?

Regards,
David

toPMML() method will be local to each scheme that<br>&gt; implements =
PMML output correct? So it is probably not necessary at the<br>&gt; =

I<br>&gt; agree that it is probably generally useful to have such a =
method, but<br>&gt; I'd probably add it to the Classifier/Clusterer =
interface (Weka 3.7).<br>&gt; This becomes a major API change - benign =
for most application<br>&gt; developers, but drastic for anyone who has =
binary serialized<br>&gt; classifiers as their models wont be loadable =
after the change.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I can't see a problem with RBFNetwork, =
MultiBoostAB etc. in 3.7.9. I<br>&gt; just tried them with the iris data =
and they are not grayed out in the<br>Explorer.<br>&gt; What data set =

of the right type for the scheme in question)?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =

David,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; My apologies for =
the delay in replying - my inbox was under heavy<br>&gt;&gt; assault =
last week and your reply got lost in the noise :-) This<br>&gt;&gt; =
sounds reasonable to me. I would suggest that we could just make =
the<br>&gt;&gt; actual schemes in Weka implement the PMMLProducer =
interface directly.<br>&gt;&gt; If variables in schemes need to be moved =
from private to protected<br>&gt;&gt; then we should do that in the core =
and in any packages (&gt;=3D Weka<br>&gt;&gt; 3.7.2) that need it. PMML =
export support would be a new feature in<br>&gt;&gt; 3.7, we can't add =
it to 3.6 because 3.6 is feature frozen to<br>&gt;&gt; correspond to =
what is described in the Witten, Frank and Hall data<br>&gt;&gt; mining =
book. I would also suggest that the interface just have a<br>&gt;&gt; =
simple toPMML() (and perhaps toPMML(String pmmlVersion)) =
methods.<br>&gt;&gt; Perhaps they could just return the XML as a String =
rather than (or in<br>&gt;&gt; addition to) the Document object? This =
would facilitate easy output<br>&gt;&gt; on the command line as is =
done<br>&gt; for graphs and trees in the dot format at =
present.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As I said =
before, I think a big part of the challenge will be with<br>&gt;&gt; =
trying to support as much of the data pre-processing (via =
Filters)<br>&gt;&gt; that classifiers do internally as possible. this is =
not so much of a<br>&gt;&gt; big deal for MultilayerPerceptron as it =
does its own internal<br>&gt;&gt; normalization and only uses the simple =
unsupervised NominalToBinary<br>&gt;&gt; filter. In general I think that =
applicable filters should implement<br>&gt;&gt; PMMLProducer too and =
produce the corresponding PMML transformation<br>&gt;&gt; dictionary =
element. This will possibly require more changes to core<br>&gt;&gt; =
Weka to allow access to internal stuff computed by the =
filter.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Anyhow, I'm =
happy to have a collaborator on this project if you<br>&gt;&gt; decide =
